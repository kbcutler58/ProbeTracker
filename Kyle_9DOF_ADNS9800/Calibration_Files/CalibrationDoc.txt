Accelerometer

1. Open Razor_Calibration.ino
2. Set sensor_select variable to = 1
3. Upload to Arduino Due
4. Open serial monitor
5. Send "r" command to reset measurements
6. Test each direction for min/max measurements due to gravity
7. Set max/min calibration numbers for RazorIMU.ino

Gyroscope

1. Open Razor_Calibration.ino
2. Set sensor_select variable to = 2
3. Upload to Arduino Due
4. Open serial monitor
4. Send "r" command to reset measurements
5. leave gyroscope still for 10-15 seconds
6. Set average noise levels for gyro calibration numbers for RazorIMU.ino

Compass

1. Open Razor_Calibration.ino
2. Set sensor_select variable to = 0
3. Upload to Arduino Due
4. Open serial monitor and check that data is being sent
5. Close serial monitor

6. Open Processing/magnet_text_gen/magnet_text_gen
7. Check to make sure serialPort matches with input data
8. Change data file name in "Rename logger = createWRiter("Data File.txt");
9. Run processing script
10. Move compass in all orientations to gather data from the compass
11. Press "C" to stop data acquisition and write text file

12. Open Matlab/magnet_calib.m
13. Change folder in line 3 to folder containing file in step 8
14. Change text file name to name of file in step 8
15. Run file 
16. Check plot to make sure there are enough points to fit
17. Output A is [x,y,z] of center of ellipsoid
18. Copy A into extended magnetometer calibration center of RazorIMU.ino
19. Output D is 9 parameter ellipsoid fit
20. Copy D into extended magnetometer 9 parameters transform of RazorIMU.ino

Enjoy!
